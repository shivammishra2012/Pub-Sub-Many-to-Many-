The Subsribes can subsribe or unsubsribe to more than one publishers as per their wish.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42523000/215242807-0cb5582a-0676-48ef-9f8f-ff06bcc7d859.png)

Pub/sub messaging has the following benefits:

It decouples subsystems that still need to communicate. Subsystems can be managed independently, and messages can be properly managed even if one or more receivers are offline.

It increases scalability and improves responsiveness of the sender. The sender can quickly send a single message to the input channel, then return to its core processing responsibilities. The messaging infrastructure is responsible for ensuring messages are delivered to interested subscribers.

It improves reliability. Asynchronous messaging helps applications continue to run smoothly under increased loads and handle intermittent failures more effectively.

It allows for deferred or scheduled processing. Subscribers can wait to pick up messages until off-peak hours, or messages can be routed or processed according to a specific schedule.

It enables simpler integration between systems using different platforms, programming languages, or communication protocols, as well as between on-premises systems and applications running in the cloud.

It facilitates asynchronous workflows across an enterprise.

It improves testability. Channels can be monitored and messages can be inspected or logged as part of an overall integration test strategy.

It provides separation of concerns for your applications. Each application can focus on its core capabilities, while the messaging infrastructure handles everything required to reliably route messages to multiple consumers.
